# Computer Vision Portfolio
My name is Aleksei Pustovoit, and I am a Grade 12 student at Innisdale Secondary School, set to graduate in Summer 2025. I will be enrolling in the Computer Science program at Georgian College this fall. I am passionate about computer vision and deep learning, and I enjoy building models that can interpret and analyze images. This portfolio showcases my projects, demonstrating my ability to develop and optimize neural networks for real-world applications.

I have worked extensively with PyTorch, focusing on CNNs, object detection models, RNNs, transfer learning, and data augmentation. I also experimented with custom datasets, demonstrating my ability to handle real-world data and improve model generalization.

## Projects Overview
Object Detection: Implementation of YOLOv1 with evaluation metrics such as IoU, mAP, and NMS.
(Due to the lack of computation power I did not trained YOLOv1)

*CNN Models*: Comparative study of LeNet, AlexNet, VGG16, GoogleNet, and ResNet to understand their performance trade-offs.
(Due to the lack of computation power I did not trained VGG,GoogleNet and ResNet)

*Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)*: Implementation of RNN, LSTM, and GRU models for sequence-based tasks.

*Transfer Learning*: Leveraging pretrained models to improve image classification accuracy.

*Albumentations*: Advanced image augmentation techniques to enhance model robustness.

*Custom Datasets*: Creating, preprocessing, and training models on custom image datasets to explore real-world applications.

I am actively looking for opportunities in computer vision research and development. Feel free to explore my projects, and reach out for collaborations! ðŸš€
